This repository contains the Control and Compliance Checklist developed as part of an internal IT audit for Botium Toys, a growing U.S.-based toy company with expanding online sales domestically and internationally.

Background
The IT audit was initiated to:

Assess and enhance the company’s cybersecurity posture following the implementation of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF).

Identify and mitigate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to Botium Toys’ critical IT assets.

Ensure compliance with applicable regulations regarding online payment processing and international business operations, particularly focusing on U.S. and European Union (E.U.) requirements.

Scope & Goals
Comprehensive review of the current IT infrastructure supporting Botium Toys’ physical and online business presence.

Risk assessment based on assets managed by the IT department and potential compliance gaps.

Highlight potential risks, vulnerabilities, and fines that could impact business continuity and regulatory compliance.

Purpose of This Checklist
This checklist serves as a practical tool to:

Verify the implementation of appropriate controls aligned with NIST CSF functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).

Track compliance with industry standards and relevant regulations (e.g., PCI-DSS for payment security, GDPR for E.U. data protection).

Guide continuous improvement efforts in the company’s IT security and governance processes.
