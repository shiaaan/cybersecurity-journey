# cybersecurity-journey
I am a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast transitioning from a background in cryptocurrency arbitrage into the world of digital defense. My experience trading across global markets—including INR, USD, EUR, and RUB—on platforms like Binance, Bybit, and Payeer, has exposed me to the real-world risks, vulnerabilities, and threats faced by users in decentralized financial ecosystems.

Engaging with victims of fraud and scams in crypto communities has fueled my drive to enter the information security domain—not just to analyze threats, but to actively defend against them. These first-hand insights into social engineering, phishing attacks, scam tactics, and exchange vulnerabilities have shaped my understanding of how threat actors operate.

A pivotal moment that cemented my career path was a high-profile scam targeting users of Bybit, where phishing campaigns and impersonation schemes led to widespread wallet compromises. Investigating how attackers bypassed 2FA, cloned platforms, and socially engineered users opened my eyes to the complexity and psychological aspect of cybercrime. My curiosity about the techniques used in these attacks deepened my interest in blue team operations and defensive security.

I’ve complemented my interest with formal learning through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and am currently preparing for CompTIA Security+ and Microsoft SC-900. I enjoy working on blue team exercises—network monitoring, log analysis, SIEM use, and vulnerability detection—and I'm actively building projects, labs, and tool-based walkthroughs to sharpen my practical skills.

Through my GitHub, I aim to showcase my learning journey, projects, tools, and security-focused labs as I grow toward becoming a skilled information security analyst. My ultimate goal is to protect both individuals and institutions from cyber threats and contribute meaningfully to the security community.
